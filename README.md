# [Data Structures and Algorithms Nanodegree](https://eu.udacity.com/course/data-structures-and-algorithms-nanodegree--nd256)
 Solve defined problems related to a particular data structure and algorithm.
 
## Projects
Evaluate and assess different data structures and algorithms for any open-ended problem and implement a solution based on our design choices.

* __Project 0__ : Unscramble Computer Science Problems

We will complete five tasks based on a fabricated set of calls and texts exchanged during September 2016 and perform a run time analysis (Worst Case Big-O Notation) of the solution.

* __Project 1__ : Show Me the Data Structures

We will answer six practice problems about a variety of topics (LRU Cache, File Recursion, Huffman Coding, Active Directory, Blockchain, Union and Intersection) related to the data structures. 

* __Project 2__ : Problems vs Algorithms

We will answer the seven questions which cover a variety of topics related to algorithms (binary search, sorting algorithms, Faster & conquer algorithms). write up a clean and efficient answer in Python, as well as a text explanation of the efficiency of our code and our design choices.

* __Project 3__ : Route Planner

We will build a route-planning algorithm like the one used in Google Maps to calculate the shortest path between two points on a map.
