# Investigating Texts and Calls
## Project Overview
In this project, we will complete five tasks based on a fabricated set of calls and texts exchanged during September 2016 and perform a run time analysis (Worst Case Big-O Notation) of the solution.

## About the data 
The text and call data are provided in csv files `Task0.py`, `Task1.py`, ...,`Task4.py` 
and two csv files `calls.csv` and `texts.csv`

The text data (`text.csv`) has the following columns: sending telephone number (string), receiving telephone number (string), timestamp of text message (string).

The call data (`call.csv)` has the following columns: calling telephone number (string), receiving telephone number (string), start timestamp of telephone call (string), duration of telephone call in seconds (string)

All telephone numbers are 10 or 11 numerical digits long. Each telephone number starts with a code indicating the location and/or type of the telephone number. There are three different kinds of telephone numbers, each with a different format:

+ Fixed lines start with an area code enclosed in brackets. The area codes vary in length but always begin with 0. Example: "(**022**)40840621".
+ Mobile numbers have no parentheses, but have a space in the middle of the number to help readability. The mobile code of a mobile number is its first four digits and they always start with 7, 8 or 9. Example: "**9341**2 66159".
+ Telemarketers' numbers have no parentheses or space, but start with the code 140. Example: "**140**2316533".

## Tasks

* __TASK 0__: What is the first record of texts and what is the last record of calls?
```
First record of texts, 97424 22395 texts 90365 06212 at time 01-09-2016 06:03:22                                        
Last record of calls, 98447 62998 calls (080)46304537 at time 30-09-2016 23:57:15, lasting 2151 seconds
```
__Runtime analysis__: O(1)

* __TASK 1__: How many different telephone numbers are there in the records?
```
There are 570 different telephone numbers in the records.
```
__Runtime analysis__: O(n)

* __TASK 2__: Which telephone number spent the longest time on the phone during the period? 
```
(080)33251027 spent the longest time, 90456 seconds, on the phone during September 2016.
```
__Runtime analysis__: O(n)

* __TASK 3__:
__Part A__: Find all of the area codes and mobile prefixes called by people in Bangalore.
```
The numbers called by people in Bangalore have codes: ['(022)', '(040)', '(04344)', '(044)', '(04546)', '(0471)', '(080)', '(0821)', '7406', '7795', '7813', '7829', '8151', '8152', '8301', '8431', '8714', '9008', '9019', '9035', '9036', '9241', '9242', '9341', '9342', '9343', '9400', '9448', '9449', '9526', '9656', '9738', '9740', '9741', '9742', '9844', '9845', '9900', '9961']     
```

__Part B__: What percentage of calls from fixed lines in Bangalore are made
to fixed lines also in Bangalore?
```
24.81 percent of calls from fixed lines in Bangalore are calls to other fixed lines in Bangalore. 
```
__Runtime analysis__: O(nÂ²)

* __TASK 4__:
The telephone company want to identify numbers that might be doing telephone marketing. 
Create a set of possible telemarketers: these are numbers that make outgoing calls but never send texts, receive texts or receive incoming calls.
```
These numbers could be telemarketers: ['(022)37572285', '(022)65548497', '(022)68535788', '(022)69042431', '(040)30429041', '(044)22020822', '(0471)2171438', '(0471)6579079', '(080)20383942', '(080)25820765', '(080)31606520', '(080)40362016', '(080)60463379', '(080)60998034', '(080)62963633', '(080)64015211', '(080)69887826', '(0821)3257740', '1400481538', '1401747654', '1402316533', '1403072432', '1403579926', '1404073047', '1404368883', '1404787681', '1407539117', '1408371942', '1408409918', '1408672243', '1409421631', '1409668775', '1409994233', '74064 66270', '78291 94593', '87144 55014', '90351 90193', '92414 69419', '94495 03761', '97404 30456', '97407 84573', '97442 45192', '99617 25274']
