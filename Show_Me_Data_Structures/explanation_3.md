I have implemented huffman encoding technique here with following steps:

* Take string and determine the relevant frequencies of the characters
* Builds and sort a list of tuples from lowest to highest frequencies
* Use dictionnary as a Huffman Tree

- Time complexity: O(n) 
- Space complexity: O(n)
